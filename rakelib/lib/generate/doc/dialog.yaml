            Note that dialogs need to be explicitly destroyed when closed and not used anymore. The traditional code for this would be like:
      :programlisting:
        - :pattern: !ruby/regexp /MyAskDialog.*\*dlg/
          :replace: |
            
            ```ruby
              def ask_user
                dlg = MyAskDialog.new(...)
                if dlg.show_modal == Wx::ID_OK
                  # ...
                #else: dialog was cancelled or some another button pressed
                end  
              
                dlg.destroy
              end
            ```
        - :pattern: !ruby/regexp /dlg\.ShowModal\(\)/
          :replace: |
            
            ```ruby
              def ask_user
                MyAskDialog(...) do |dlg|
                  if dlg.show_modal == Wx::ID_OK
                    # ...
                  #else: dialog was cancelled or some another button pressed
                  end  
                end
              end
            ```
